Desktop XP is an interactive multimedia installation that runs from a Python script in parallel with a SuperCollider script.

You can find the media assets here:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1PqWf4OMqCEkv-t-AvW1CBQrc2MbXkMRb?usp=sharing

The Python script utilizes a dynamic library, so be sure to download the entire Media Assets folder and run the Python script from the same directory as the Media Assets folder.

When launching the experience, start the SC2 script before running the main Python script.
